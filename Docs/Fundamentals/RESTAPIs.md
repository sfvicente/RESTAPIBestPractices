# REST APIs
REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are a type of web service that adhere to the principles of REST, which is an architectural
style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are based on a client-server communication model where clients send requests
to servers to perform operations on resources (e.g., data, files) using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. 

Key characteristics of REST APIs include:

1. **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary for the server to understand and fulfill the request. The server doesn't store any client state between requests.

2. **Resource-based**: REST APIs are centered around resources, which are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Clients interact with these resources using standard HTTP methods.

3. **Uniform Interface**: RESTful APIs use a uniform and predefined set of operations (HTTP methods) to interact with resources. This simplifies the architecture and improves scalability.

4. **Client-Server Architecture**: REST APIs separate the client from the server. This separation allows each part to evolve independently and promotes scalability.

5. **Cacheability**: Responses from a REST API can be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable, which improves performance and efficiency.

6. **Layered System**: REST APIs can be implemented in a layered architecture, where different components (e.g., proxies, gateways) can handle different aspects of the communication without affecting the overall system behavior.

7. **Stateless Communication**: RESTful communication is stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary for the server to understand and fulfill the request.

These principles help in designing scalable, efficient, and maintainable APIs that can be easily consumed by various clients (web browsers, mobile apps, etc.) across different platforms.

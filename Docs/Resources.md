## General


### Model the services around domain entities using the standard HTTP methods as operation indicators.

Do not model service operations as actions. Instead, identify the domain entities that are the components of the API model 
and use the standard HTTP methods to perform the operations on those entities.

For example, do not use the following operation:

// TODO: complement description

```http
// TODO: add examples
```

// TODO: add description

```http
// TODO: add examples
```

### Design the API to limit the amount of data returned by any single request.

// TODO: add description

```http
// TODO: add examples
```

### Consider using a nested URI structure if a sub-resource is only accessible via its parent resource and may not exist without the parent resource.

// TODO: add description

```http
// TODO: add examples
```

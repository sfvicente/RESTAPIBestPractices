## Authentication
<br>


### Avoid submitting authentication credentials in the request body.

Although uncommon, it is a possible implementation for an API authentication. However this would indicate a non-RESTful design, which
is not recommended.

```http
// TODO: add example
```

// TODO: complement description

```http
// TODO: add example
```
